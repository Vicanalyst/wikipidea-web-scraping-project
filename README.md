🌐📊 Extracting Kenyan County GDP Per Capita Data from Wikipedia 🇰🇪💰

Curious about Kenyan counties' economic performance? 📈 I've utilized the power of web scraping to gather insightful GDP per capita data. 🌐💡

🔗 Source URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_of_Kenya_by_GDP

The web page boasts three tables, and my focus was the second one, adorned with the class 'wikitable sortable.' 📊

Columns within the table include:
- Rank
- County
- GDP Per Capita (Kshs)
- GDP Per Capita in US $ (PPP)

The captured data was neatly molded into a dataframe named 'df.' 📊 To ensure the information's accessibility, I've saved the dataframe as a CSV file.
